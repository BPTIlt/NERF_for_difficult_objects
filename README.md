# NERF_for_difficult_objects
NERF application to recover geometry of shiny and transparent objects.

# Sources
This implementation is based on the following sources:
1. [nerf_pl](https://github.com/kwea123/nerf_pl)
1. [LLFF](https://github.com/Fyusion/LLFF)

Note: although it would seem that this repository also depends on the [torchsearchsorted](https://github.com/aliutkus/torchsearchsorted/tree/1e0ffc3e0663ffda318b4e28348efd90313d08f3) repository, in reality the dependency was removed by using implementations of the respective functions from a newer version of PyTorch.
